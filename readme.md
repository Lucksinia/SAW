# Self Avoiding Walks #

## About ##

This is a small script that implements Self avoiding walk (SAW) in 2D space.

*SAW* - is a path that never intersects itself, that's moving in 2D grid space(in case of this script).
Tis whole concept is based on [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) wich are in part interlinked with [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).
